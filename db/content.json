    "description": "When we first met, we were both out of our skin \nAnd we had no idea the trouble we'd get in\nWe acted out of impulse cos that's all that we've learned\nThe ones who came before showed us how love hurts\n\nAnd we learned that the passion you feel is a piano\nDangling from a rooftop right above your head\nAnd soon, one day, your lover comes to cut the wire\nSo it's easier to never fall in love instead.\n\nBut I want to wake up with you by my side\nI want to feel your kiss on my eyes when I go to sleep at night\nAnd I want to know, as hard as I love you, that you love me too despite what we've been through\nI want to dream\nI want to dream of you\n\nAnd it's all that I do.\n\nI faced my fears and the darkness of my past\nTo show you that I'm here to stay and I think we could last\nBut I can see you're running, you're scared to face your heart\nIn case it shows you something that tears your world apart\n\nNow, I'm not one for patience, I was born to soldier on\nMy restlessness will carry me until the day is done\nBut there's something about your smile that tethers me to you\nSo I will wait here patiently, until you see me too.\n\nCos I want to wake up with you by my side\nI want to feel your kiss on my eyes when I go to sleep at night\nAnd I want to know, as hard as I love you, that you love me too despite what we've been through\nI want to dream\nI want to dream of you\n\nAnd it's all that I do.",
